% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
% See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.

%   General parameters, for ALL pages:
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9}	% max fraction of floats at top
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
%   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
\setcounter{topnumber}{2}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
\setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.07}	% allow minimal text w. figs
%   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages
% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
