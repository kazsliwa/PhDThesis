\noindent 
Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this thesis all represent original papers written by
myself, Nathan W. C. Leigh and published in the \textit{Monthly
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society} (\textit{MNRAS}).  The
reference for Chapter 
2 is Leigh N., Sills A. 2010, \textit{MNRAS}, 410, 2370, and Dr. Alison Sills is
the only co-author.  The reference for Chapter 3 is Leigh N., Sills
A., Knigge C. 2009, \textit{MNRAS}, 399L, 179, and Dr. Alison Sills and
Dr. Christian Knigge are co-authors.  Chapters 4 and 5 have both been
accepted for publication in the \textit{MNRAS}, however they had not
yet been assigned journal codes at the time of publication of this
thesis.  Dr. Alison Sills and Dr. Christian Knigge are co-authors on 
both of these two publications.  Dr. Knigge provided a great deal of guidance in
choosing the appropriate statistical techniques throughout all of our
analyses, and offered
considerable advice in analyzing and interpreting our results.  He
also had a number of noteworthy 
creative contributions to the analytic model presented in Chapter 5.
All previously published material has been 
reformatted to conform to the required thesis 
style.  I grant an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to McMaster
University and the National Library of Canada to reproduce this
material as part of this thesis.
