Dear Referee,

Thank you for the comments and suggestions. I do apologize for the slow response. I am in the middle of applying for postdoc positions. I have addressed all the comments. I have bolded all the changes I have made to the text. Below are our responses:

1. Section 3, paragraph 2 
The authors proceed discussion, by comparing molecular gas emission and 
dust lane structures in the optical, but I cannot understand 
which particular features in the ALMA molecular gas data and 
HST images are discussed. It is more kind to readers, if arrows are 
inserted for the features which the authors are discussing 
in Figure 1 (bottom middle).
Response: I have added arrows and annotated the HST panel in Figure 1.

2. Section 4, paragraph 3
The authors investigate physical conditions at five positions: 
north, south, east, and west parts of the ring, and the nucleus. 
However, the information of the location (coordinate) and size 
used for this investigation is missing. This information should 
be provided.
Response: I added the J2000 coordinates to the text. I also added green crosses on the CO J=2-1 map in Figure 1. 

3. Figure 1, caption
I guess the elliptical patterns at the bottom left part of each figure 
represents the beam size of each molecular line, but the explanation 
is missing in the Figure 1 caption.
Response: I added text to the caption in Figure 1 to address this.

4. Section 2.3, Table 1
The authors estimate the 440 um continuum flux. 
Is it consistent between ALMA USB and LSB data? 
A brief description is desirable. 
Response: The continuum is consistent in structure and flux in the USB and LSB. I added 3 sentences to reflect this. Note that I changed 440um to 435um_rest. 

5. Possible typos
Section 3, paragraph 3, line 2
440 u -> 440 um (?)
Section 5, paragraph 4, line 7 from the end
of1.1-1.4 -> of 1.1-1.4 (?)
Response: Corrected.

Sincerely,

Kazimierz Sliwa
